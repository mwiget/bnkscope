"""
BNK Data Service — backward-compatible re-export shim.

All logic has been decomposed into the ``services.bnk`` package:
    - ``services.bnk.helpers``              — shared K8s dict utilities
    - ``services.bnk.fetch``                — parallel CRD + pod fetching
    - ``services.bnk.health``               — health dashboard analysis
    - ``services.bnk.topology``             — gateway topology tree
    - ``services.bnk.backends``             — service/route cross-reference
    - ``services.bnk.palette``              — config builder palette
    - ``services.bnk.policy_associations``  — security policy mapping

Existing ``from services.bnk_data_service import ...`` imports continue
to work unchanged. New code should import from ``services.bnk`` directly.
