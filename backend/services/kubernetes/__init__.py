"""
Cloud-agnostic Kubernetes service for bnkscope.
Works with EKS, AKS, GKE, on-prem, and any Kubernetes distribution.

Split into focused modules for maintainability:
  _base.py       — cluster access, kubeconfig, connection testing
  _resources.py  — generic CRUD (get, create, update, delete)
  _describe.py   — describe resource, events
  _pods.py       — pod logs, restart, container listing
  _metrics.py    — pod/node metrics (kubectl top)
  _rollouts.py   — deployment rollout history, status, undo, restart
  _operations.py — patch, label, annotate, scale, cordon, uncordon, drain
