"""Janitor for stale tasks and stuck-destroying entities.

Background — when a worker dies mid-orchestration, when the API container
restarts during a deploy, or when a Celery task is lost from the broker, the
DB row remains stuck in `pending` or `in_progress` indefinitely. The next
deploy attempt then trips on a 409 Conflict because the orchestrator sees an
"in-flight" execution that nothing is actually working on.

Strategy — derive the set of live Celery task IDs from the existing Redis
worker-heartbeat (avoids slow `inspect()` broadcasts), then mark any non-
terminal row whose task_id isn't in that set as failed. Safe to call on boot
and periodically.

Empty/unreachable Redis is treated as "nothing alive" — strict improvement
over the prior boot-time behaviour which always reset every in_progress row.

D-001 Phase 3 S3b: ParallelExecution table dropped (migration v2_119).
`reset_stale_parallel_executions` removed. `reset_stale_destroys` reworked
to detect stuck entities from StackInstance.status + Task rows only (no PE).

    Architect Q6 terminal safety net. Complements reset_stale_tasks (which handles Task rows)

      - The StackInstance is in DESTROYING status, AND
      - There are no live destroy tasks (all celery_task_ids are dead or absent), AND
      - There are no non-terminal destroy Task rows remaining for this stack's scope.
