"""
K8s route sub-package — split from the monolithic kubernetes.py (2,926 lines).

Each module owns a focused domain:
  clusters.py   — Cluster CRUD, test, refresh, namespaces, scan, adaptive modules
  resources.py  — Generic K8s resource CRUD, pod/node ops, metrics, rollouts
  f5bnk.py      — F5 BNK data (gateways, firewall, egress, topology, health)
  dpf.py        — NVIDIA DPF data (DPU devices, clusters, services, health)
  tmm_debug.py  — TMM debug sidecar diagnostics (tmctl, configview, bdt_cli)
  recovery.py   — Post-reboot recovery (CWC cert re-sync, platform restart)

All routers keep prefix="/api" to preserve existing API paths.
