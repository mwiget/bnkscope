# === bnkscope Orphan Volume Cleanup ===
#
# Removes Docker volumes whose name starts with the compose project prefix
# (default: bnkscope_ or bnkscope-) but whose `com.docker.compose.project`
# label is missing or doesn't match the current project.
#
# These are typically left over from a renamed deployment, a previous project
# name, or volumes that were created outside of compose. Compose will mount
# them but disowns them with the warning "not built with compose".
#
# Always prompts before removing. Volumes currently in use by a container
# cannot be removed and will be skipped by `docker volume rm`.
