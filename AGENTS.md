# AGENTS.md — Coding Agent Reference

> Optional. This file exists for coding agents; nothing in this repo requires
> you to use one. Humans should read **[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)**
> (build, test, architecture, style, gotchas) and
> **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** (contribution process) instead — those
> are the source of truth, and this file only adds agent-specific framing on top.

**Agents: read [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) first.** It carries the
build/lint/test commands, architecture, project structure, code style, testing
conventions, key gotchas, and git workflow. The sections below are the extra
context an autonomous agent needs and a human does not.

## Roadmap & Tracking — what to work on

**Asked "what's next"?** Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` (the shared roadmap; clickable human view `docs/roadmap.html`) and take the highest-priority **unblocked** item with an open GitHub issue. New decisions/epics flow **ADR → GitHub issue → roadmap → PR** per `docs/ROADMAP_PROCESS.md`. **GitHub issues are the source of truth for "done"**.

## Behavioral Guidelines

Bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
- Check whether it already exists. Grep for the capability by name and by what it shells out to (`docker`/`buildx`, `helm`, `kubectl`, Make targets) before writing new code — extend the existing path, don't fork a parallel one.
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask: *"Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"* If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports / variables / functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
